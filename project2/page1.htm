	<h2>How to Play League of Legends</h2>
	<p> On Summoners Rift, the map that League is played on, there are 3 lanes Top lane, Mid Lane, and Bot lane. The center of the 
map is divided by a river, and everything in between contains the jungle. Every lane has an outer tower, followed by an inner tower, 
followed by an Inhib tower, then an inhibitor, and finally 2 nexus towers guarding the Nexus. You and your team mates have to 
destroy enemy towers to gain access to their base, and ultimatly their nexus. At the start of the game you and your team spawn in 
your fountain at the back of your base, here you can buy items with gold you acquire as well as heal and restore your mana. You start
the game at level 1 and 500 gold to buy a starting item. As you play the game you get experience to level up, and gold to buy more items
in order to become stronger. You gather gold and experience buy killing minions, slaying enemy champions, destroying towers, or killing
monsters in the jungle. Minions automaticaly spawn for each team at their nexus and march down every lane to help seige towers. If your
team destroys an enemy inhibitor than super minions will spawn into that lane helping you sige into their base. In the river

<h3>The Five Roles</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Top Lane</b></li>
	<p>Top Lane is the most isolated lane with a big focus on 1 verse 1 against their lane opponent. The
traditional top lane champions include tanks, fighters, and duelists.</p>
  <li><b>Jungle</b></li>
	<p>The Jungle is perhaps the most unique role, because they are the only role whose primary gold and 
experience comes from the camps in the jungle, rather than the minions in lane. The traditional jungle champions
include tanks, assassins, and fighter.</p>
  <li><b>Mid Lane</b></li>
	<p>Mid lane is one of the primary carry positions. Mid laners usually play high damage champions that
can win teamfights or duels,but they a high risk of dying because they are less mobile and have less health. 
The traditionally mid lane champions include mages, or assassins.</p>
  <li><b>ADC</b></li>
	<p>ADC stands for Attack Damage Carry. ADC's are the bot laners who are the other primary carry like mid
laners. ADC's are traditonaly the least unique in champion type because they are all ranged marksmen who like mid
laners have very high damage, but are very easy to kill.</p>
  <li><b>Support</b></li>
	<p>Supports are also in the botlane with the ADC making botlane the only lane with two players. Their job is
what you think, to support. They help their ADC get kills to make them strong, and help them avoid death from the 
enemies. However supports help everyone on their team, and are just as important as an other role. The traditional
support champions include casters, mages, and tanks.</p>
</ul>
