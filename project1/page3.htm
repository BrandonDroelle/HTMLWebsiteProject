<p>
League of Legends is the biggest Esport in the world. For ten consecuative years League has been hosting
tournaments around the world for fans to watch. In League of Legends there are two major international 
tournaments a year, MSI, or Mid Season Invitational, and Worlds. MSI takes place half way through the year every
summer, hense why it's called mid season, and Worlds takes place and the end of the year in October. The four
main regions North America, Europe, Korea, and China all send their best teams to compete based on the winners
of each regions seasonal tournament, in addition other smaller regions, like Brazil, Turkey, Oceania, or Japan 
each have a shot of fighting for the few remaining spots in the tournament. These events are huge worldwide.

eliminated in playoffs to TSM.
