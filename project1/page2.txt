	<h2>The Lore of League of Legends</h2>
	<p>
The Universe of League of Legends mostly takes place in Runeterra. Runeterra has multiple regions from icy
tundra, rolling plains, tall mountains, thick jungles, and hot deserts. Every champion in League of Legends
has their origin. They come from all walks of life and come in many shapes and sizes. Many champions come
from one the main factions below, but many come from places not charted on any map, like the void. In League 
there is a champion for everyone, you can play as a pirate, a sorceror, a gunslinger, a swordsman, a giant 
monster, a space dragon, a giant talking rat, or a cat, and many more. Each champion has their own personality
which is expressed through their look, their playstyle, and their voicelines.
